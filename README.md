Graph: we observe a number around 40-50 where the chart goes vertical, that is by my understanding because we hit a integer value that is so large that it must be stored differently and we may incur some overhead or perhaps lose some cache as a result, and of course the trend is towards larger compute times as the number gets higher which is expected.
